The trees are being torn down and used to fuel the raging smelters that are making deadly weapons and engines of war. In your desperate quest to prevent the annihilation of the forest you must face many dangers. But will you be able to stop the heartless mercenaries and their Infernal Machine as it smashes the very heart of the forest, the Tree of Life?|

## Notes about ZIL version

- No in-game illustrations or graphics (also excludes map from the book)

- Some changes to the text were made: spelling errors/consistency, some were rephrased to fit the "digital" format or the implemented mechanisms 
- Select an action by pressing the number keys that correspond to the option (**1** - **9**). If there are more than 9 options, items 10-15 map to the keys **A** (or **a**) - **F** (or **f**)
- Press **q** or **Q** during action selection to quit or terminate the program
- Press **c** or **C** during action selection to view character (items, skills, codewords)

- Paradoxical or continuity errors (as pointed out by some reviewers/readers) are preserved since the ZIL was adapted verbatim from the book.
