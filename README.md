The trees are being torn down and used to fuel the raging smelters that are making deadly weapons and engines of war. In your desperate quest to prevent the annihilation of the forest you must face many dangers. But will you be able to stop the heartless mercenaries and their Infernal Machine as it smashes the very heart of the forest, the Tree of Life?|

- Paradoxical or continuity errors (as pointed out by some reviewers/readers) are preserved since the ZIL was adapted verbatim from the book.
